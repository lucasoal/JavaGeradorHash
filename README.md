# - Java Gerador Hash - [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg" alt="Java Logo" width="20" Title="Java" align='right'>](https://dev.java/)

_**My first project developed with Java programming language.**_

## About the project

The idea of the App is:

_"Check changes to a file and/or group of files, through
of the HASH code. In this case, considering that the text file was generated at a time T, it should be possible to verify, in
any time greater than T, if there has been a change in any of the files indexed in the text file. "_

## Why?

Encryption is the technique of cipher (encoded) writing, through which it is possible to transform an incoming message
(set of bits) in an output message (another set of bits). Encryption can be applied to a stream of bytes,
to a single file, to a set of files, to a directory (folder) of files, to an entire storage unit
(discs, tapes, cards, among others).
