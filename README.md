## About the project

The idea of the App is:

_"Check changes to a file and/or group of files, through
of the HASH code. In this case, considering that the text file was generated at a time T, it should be possible to verify, in
any time greater than T, if there has been a change in any of the files indexed in the text file. "_

_Complementary activity for completing the Security and Cryptography subject of the Computer Science course given by the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, Poços de Caldas-MG campus._

## Why?

Encryption is the technique of cipher (encoded) writing, through which it is possible to transform an incoming message
(set of bits) in an output message (another set of bits). Encryption can be applied to a stream of bytes,
to a single file, to a set of files, to a directory (folder) of files, to an entire storage unit
(discs, tapes, cards, among others).

## Functionalities

- **Generate the hash code of a directory, subfolders and/or file indicated by the user.**


- **Analysis of a directory/file**
  - File Hash Code Generation
  - Generation of folder hash code
  - Subfolders and subfiles are included


- **Choice of Hash Generation Method**
  - MD5
  - SHA-1
  - SHA-256


- **Process Report**
  - `logs.txt` file is generated
  - It will contain all Hashs generated by the application.


- **Format**
  - `[Method] Hash → Directory Path`
  - `[MD5] 8C9C7BFEE84EDA5C78AF2985ADB40C9C	→ /home/user/Desktop/folder/image1.png`
